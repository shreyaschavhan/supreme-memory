The behavior of "HTML strings can be changed by the browser during rendering" is called mutation. And the XSS achieved by exploiting this behavior is naturally called mutation XSS.

<style> is a magical tag because everything inside this tag is interpreted as text.

But here's the interesting part. If we add an outer <svg>, the way the browser interprets it will be different, and everything changes. The current HTML source code is:

<svg>
    <style>
        <a id="test"></a>
    </style>
</svg>

The <a> inside the <style> becomes an actual HTML element, not just plain text.


This was the problamatic payload for bypassing DOMPurify sanitization:

<svg></p><style><a id="</style><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>">
