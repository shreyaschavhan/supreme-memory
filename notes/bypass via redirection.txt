when CSP encounters a server side redirection that leads to a different origin that is not allowed, the CSP won't get bypassed.

however accroding to the description in CSP spec 4.2.2.3. paths and redirections, if the redirection leads to a different path, it can bypass the original restrictions.

For example:

CSP is: script-src http://localhost:5555 https://www.google.com/a/b/c/d


```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="script-src http://localhost:5555 https://www.google.com/a/b/c/d">
</head>
<body>
  <div id=userContent>
    <script src="https://https://www.google.com/test"></script>
    <script src="https://https://www.google.com/a/test"></script>
    <script src="http://localhost:5555/301"></script>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

If CSP is sert to `https://www.google.com/a/b/c/d`, since the path is considered both `/test` and `/a/test` scripts will be blocked by CSP.

However, the final http://localhost:5555/301 will be redirected on the server-side to https://www.google.com/complete/search?client=chrome&q=123&jsonp=alert(1)//. Since it is a redirection, the path is not considered, and the script can be loaded, thus bypassing the path restriction.

With this redirection, even if the path is specified completely, it will still be bypassed.
